sdesc: "Remote Desktop Protocol library (development)"
ldesc: "FreeRDP is a successor to rdesktop, a longtime-favored 
application for use on *nix systems to access Windows servers and 
workstations. The goal of FreeRDP is twofold: a more complete support of 
keyboard layouts; and support of newer Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 
features found in the Windows 6.0 (Vista/2008) & 6.1 (7/2008R2) 
environments."
